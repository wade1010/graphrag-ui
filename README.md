# GraphRAG-UI

GraphRAG-UI is a user-friendly interface for [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag), a powerful tool that uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to index and query large text data. This project supports the latest version graphrag-0.3.3 and aims to provide a convenient management and interaction method for GraphRAG, supporting the configuration of local large language models like Ollama, making it easier for users to leverage.

## Acknowledgments

This project is currently an upgrade based on the work of [severian42](https://github.com/severian42) and his [GraphRAG-Local-UI](https://github.com/severian42/GraphRAG-Local-UI) project. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to him for laying a solid foundation for this project. New features may be added in the future.

## Features

- **Intuitive Web Interface**: GraphRAG-UI provides a user-friendly web interface for easy configuration and use of GraphRAG.
- **Index Management**: Quickly create, update, and manage your text data indexes.
- **Query Execution**: Submit natural language queries and retrieve relevant content from indexed data, followed by responses from a large language model.
- **Configuration Options**: Customize various settings and parameters to fine-tune the indexing and querying processes.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Monitor the progress of indexing and querying tasks through detailed logs and status updates.
